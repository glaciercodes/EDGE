        <article class="card accent-ai">

          <span class="pill">AI • Technology</span>

          <h2>How is AI changing work today—not someday?</h2>

          <h3>From code generation to safe deployment, here’s what to know right now.</h3>

          <div class="byline">Tool‑agnostic, human‑centered, and practical.</div>

          <p>AI doesn’t erase expertise; it compresses the distance from idea to draft and from prototype to test. The winners pair strong fundamentals with machine assistance: precise specs, tight review loops, and clear accountability. Below are five high‑curiosity questions with partially collapsible answers—scan the teasers, open to read the deeper guidance.</p>

          <div class="faq">

            <details>

              <summary>Is AI going to replace programmers?<span class="teaser"> Short answer: it replaces repetitive typing, not responsibility; the role shifts to specification, verification, and integration.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                AI excels at boilerplate, scaffolding, and translations between frameworks. Programmers move up the stack: framing problems, choosing architectures, designing tests, and protecting systems. Treat AI like a junior pair: fast, tireless, occasionally wrong. Keep guardrails—linting, unit/integration tests, code review, and threat modeling. The career moat is domain knowledge plus taste in trade‑offs; those aren’t auto‑generated.

                <ul class="keypoints">

                  <li>Draft quickly → test ruthlessly.</li>

                  <li>Prefer small PRs; verify with CI.</li>

                  <li>Document decisions so future you can trust past you.</li>

                </ul>

                <span class="hint">Tip: keep a “gotchas” file for recurring hallucinations and edge cases.</span>

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>Is AI bad or dangerous?<span class="teaser"> Risk depends on design and use; safety grows from privacy‑by‑default, audits, and narrow deployments before scale.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Harms range from data leakage to biased outcomes and over‑reliance. Mitigate by minimizing sensitive inputs, isolating workloads, red‑teaming prompts/outputs, and logging decisions. Start with clear use limits; escalate only after monitoring. Communicate capabilities and failures plainly to keep users in the loop.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>Does AI really make me more productive?<span class="teaser"> Yes—when you articulate acceptance criteria and measure output quality, not just speed.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Use AI for drafts, scaffolds, unit tests, and API glue. Maintain a definition of done (DoD) and compare cycle time before/after. Many teams see faster throughput and fewer context‑switches. The point isn’t more stories closed—it’s fewer defects escaping.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>Is technology the same as science?<span class="teaser"> Science explains; technology applies. They dance together but have different goals.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Science seeks reliable truths about nature via hypotheses and evidence. Technology applies knowledge to build tools and systems. Good products respect both: theory informs design; field feedback refines understanding.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>Is technology dangerous?<span class="teaser"> Any powerful tool can harm; governance, secure defaults, and human oversight reduce risk.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Adopt least‑privilege access, fail‑safe modes, and transparent incident handling. For end users, demand plain‑language settings and the ability to opt out. Safer tech is designed, not wished into being.

        <article class="card accent-money">

          <span class="pill">Money • Investing</span>

          <h2>How do you build wealth calmly—without chasing headlines?</h2>

          <h3>Five starter questions that anchor a resilient plan.</h3>

          <div class="byline">Education‑first. This is general information, not financial advice.</div>

          <p>Focus on behaviors you control: saving rate, diversification, fees, and time in the market. Protect with cash buffers and insurance. Invest in yourself to raise earnings power. Then let compounding do its quiet magic.</p>

          <div class="faq">

            <details>

              <summary>How do I invest in gold?<span class="teaser"> Decide between physical, vaulted, or diversified funds; size it as insurance, not as your growth engine.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Physical coins/bars add storage and spread costs; vaulted solutions offer convenience with custody risk; funds simplify but add fees. Gold diversifies and may hedge crises, but lacks cash flow—treat as a modest allocation alongside productive assets.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>How do I invest in the stock market?<span class="teaser"> Use broad‑market funds, automate contributions, and hold for years; costs and behavior beat timing.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Pick an allocation matching your risk horizon. Dollar‑cost average monthly. Rebalance on a schedule. Keep fees low and taxes mindful. Most results come from staying invested through cycles.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>How do I invest in bitcoin?<span class="teaser"> Understand volatility and custody; only invest money you can risk, via regulated venues and secure wallets.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Crypto carries sharp swings and operational risks. If you participate, learn custody (hot vs. cold), use strong security, and size the position conservatively within a diversified plan.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>How do I invest in “money” itself?<span class="teaser"> For near‑term goals, use high‑yield cash and short‑term instruments; for growth, own businesses via funds.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Cash preserves optionality; productive assets generate returns. Match vehicles to timelines: cash (0–2 years), balanced (3–5), equities (5+), always considering your risk tolerance.

              </div>

            </details>

            <details>

              <summary>How do I invest in myself?<span class="teaser"> Skills, health, relationships, and reputation usually beat any single asset’s ROI.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Upskill toward scarce, valued work; maintain health to protect work capacity; cultivate networks; ship visible, trustworthy work—opportunity finds reliability.

          <h3>Nine essentials distilled into five focused answers.</h3>

          <div class="byline">General wellness education. Always consult qualified clinicians for personal care.</div>

          <p>Health compounds through consistent basics: sleep, movement, whole foods, sunlight, stress skills, and preventive screening. The following questions translate those into organ‑specific actions you can start today.</p>

              <summary>How can I take care of my kidneys?<span class="teaser"> Hydration, blood pressure and glucose control, and prudent medication use matter most.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Drink water through the day; limit excess salt; moderate alcohol; avoid unnecessary NSAIDs; and work with a clinician if you have hypertension, diabetes, or a family history. Early labs and urine tests catch issues before damage accumulates.

              <summary>How can I take care of my liver?<span class="teaser"> Limit alcohol, manage weight, vaccinate where recommended, and be cautious with supplements.</span></summary>

              <div class="answer">

                Non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease is tied to diet and activity; adopt fiber‑rich meals, regular exercise, and weight management. Review medications and supplements with a professional—“natural” does not mean safe for the liver.

              </div>

              <div class="answer">

                Use mild cleansers, avoid frequent high‑heat styling, and protect from UV with hats/sunscreen. For skin, moisturize, avoid smoking, and treat persistent acne/eczema with professional help.

              <div class="answer">

                Follow the 20‑20‑20 rule at screens, use proper lighting, wear protective eyewear for sun/sports/work, and schedule exams based on age and risk factors.

              <div class="answer">

                Combine aerobic and strength training, emphasize whole foods, sleep consistently, and practice stress reducers (walks, breathing, journaling). Seek help early—mental fitness is health.
